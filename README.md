<h2>Unsupervised Learning with DCGAN and VAE</h2>

<h4>This project aims at making it easy to run experiments on image datasets for the purposes
of testing different architectures for Generative Adversarial Networks (see Goodfellow 2014, 2016 NIPS) and Variational Autoencoders. The GAN architecture is that proposed by Radford et al)</h4>
